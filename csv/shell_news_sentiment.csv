At least ten tankers and containerships are changing course as the Ever Given, one of the world's largest containerships, remains stranded across the canal along Egypt, MarineTraffic spokesman Georgios Hatzimanolis told CNBC in an interview. ""We expect that number to go up as this closure progresses,"" Hatzimanolis said. The 1,300-foot ship ran aground Tuesday en route from Malaysia to the Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands. The stranded ship has caused other vessels to back up in the canal, holding up roughly $400 million an hour in goods, according to Lloyd's List shipping journal. That's slowly increased over the last several days after repeated efforts by Egypt to refloat the 247,000-ton containership have failed. Officials there are using eight large tugboats and excavation equipment on the banks of the canal to dig out sand around the grounded vessel. According to MarineTraffic, there are 97 vessels stuck in the upper portion of the canal, 23 vessels waiting in the middle and 108 vessels in the lower portion. The logjam stretches through the Red Sea, past the Gulf of Aden, all the way to the Border of Yemen and Oman. ""From Asia to Europe we are seeing ships divert in the Indian Ocean, just below the southern tip of Sri Lanka,"" added Hatzimanolis.

And once reached, can you just sort of remind us what the terms of where cash return will out turn within the guided 20%, 30% of cash flow including working capital range? The second question, Wael, it's great to have you on. In your recent Energy Transition Strategy Day, it was said that the planned capital investment of $8 billion in the upstream business in the near term is well below the investment level required to offset the natural decline in production of your oil and gas reservoirs and will not sustain current levels of production. Now, that concerns me only because having -- back to my first question, you lower your net debt, we're all looking forward to cash return. Should we be surprised or concerned that we could see a major hike in upstream capex over the next few years?
