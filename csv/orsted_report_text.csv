Decarbonising these supply chains is  essential for realising a net-zero world. "

Of course,  many questions to which we do not yet  have answers remain – namely, how to  set indicators and produce meaningful  reporting for a theme as diverse as local  community engagement – but by placing  local stakeholder insight and inspiration  at the centre of our work, we hope to find  the solutions.

As new technologies like large-scale heat  pumps develop and become cost-competitive, we  can gradually phase in these new technologies as  new sources of heat production. "

This is supported  by several scientific reports, including a recent study  from the University of Copenhagen. These reports  highlight that the right biomass will deliver signifi- cant carbon reductions in the short term. Yet, if that  biomass could have been used for construction or  furniture, which would store carbon and replace  carbon-intensive materials like steel or concrete, the  climate benefit would be significantly less.

Consequently,  we are very pleased that the Danish government  has now decided to implement sustainability criteria  that, by law, require companies importing or using  biomass for energy to clearly document its sustain- ability, type, carbon savings, and impact on biodi- versity.

The plant has the potential to decarbonise  power and heat generation and sort waste into source  materials, such as plastic and metal, for recycling. • We have created new waste and water management  policies, and improved reporting frameworks complying  with GRI standards. • All our fully operational sites work in accordance with ISO  14001.
