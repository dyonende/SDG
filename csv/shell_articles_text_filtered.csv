Hybrid engines have specific lubrication requirements that can’t be met with motor oils that have been developed for internal combustion engines only.

Botox accounts for a large share of its parent company Allergan’s business, which was a key appeal to AbbVie when it bought Allergan for more than $60 billion in 2019. Botox had, until recently, near sole control of the injectable wrinkle smoother market, but it did not have patent protection. New entrants, including Evolus, which makes Jeuveau, have begun to emerge. In 2019, Allergan filed a complaint with the I.T.C. against Evolus and its South Korean manufacturer, Daewoong, accusing Daewoong of stealing trade secrets from Allergan’s Korean partner, Medytox."

Allergan referred to a statement it made after the I.T.C.’s ruling that it “supports a marketplace that encourages product development and innovation and we welcome fair and lawful competition.”"

Just two weeks ago in the Netherlands, in a case brought by four Nigerian farmers and Friends of the Earth, the Court of Appeal of the Hague held Shell liable for certain damages suffered through oil spills in Nigeria (see Milieudefensie v Shell).16 There are cases pending in France under the duty of vigilance law (considered here).

On the Supreme Court's analysis, formal control is not necessarily the determining factor for liability, and any entity that is involved with the management of a particular function risks being held responsible for any damage flowing from the discharge of that function. In theory, claims might extend, for instance, to entities involved in supply chain supervision, minority investors and JV partners, and not just the local entity and its parent. While promulgating group wide policies may be used to suggest involvement of a parent in the acts of a local entity, at the same time, a parent company should not ignore governance or fail to provide effective policies down the corporate chain (and there are other compelling incentives to ensure good governance, including for anti-bribery and anti-corruption compliance)."

At least ten tankers and containerships are changing course as the Ever Given, one of the world's largest containerships, remains stranded across the canal along Egypt, MarineTraffic spokesman Georgios Hatzimanolis told CNBC in an interview. ""We expect that number to go up as this closure progresses,"" Hatzimanolis said. The 1,300-foot ship ran aground Tuesday en route from Malaysia to the Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands. The stranded ship has caused other vessels to back up in the canal, holding up roughly $400 million an hour in goods, according to Lloyd's List shipping journal. That's slowly increased over the last several days after repeated efforts by Egypt to refloat the 247,000-ton containership have failed. Officials there are using eight large tugboats and excavation equipment on the banks of the canal to dig out sand around the grounded vessel. According to MarineTraffic, there are 97 vessels stuck in the upper portion of the canal, 23 vessels waiting in the middle and 108 vessels in the lower portion. The logjam stretches through the Red Sea, past the Gulf of Aden, all the way to the Border of Yemen and Oman. ""From Asia to Europe we are seeing ships divert in the Indian Ocean, just below the southern tip of Sri Lanka,"" added Hatzimanolis. For Europe-bound ships coming from Asia, going around Africa instead of through the canal can add up to seven days to a ship's journey, he said."

Yes, things are far from over, but millions of people are getting vaccinated and it’s starting to seem like there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. Well, sorry to ruin things slightly, but oil companies are also starting to recover from the pandemic after it sparked a historic drop in fuel demand and crushed their profit margins."

Other oil companies have made similar moves, showing that only a planned transition away from fossil fuels can ensure those laborers are taken care of."

Although it certainly wasn’t planned, the interviews I conducted during 2020 largely coincided with the aviation sector’s worst downturn in history. The global industry has been losing tens of millions of dollars a day and has shed hundreds of thousands of jobs. Passenger volumes took a nosedive, down precipitously from 2019 levels. The global market for business travel is projected to decline 54 percent during 2020, according to data by ResearchAndMarkets.com, which predicts a robust recovery for the industry — by 2027.

CORSIA applies only to international flights, which account for most of aviation’s carbon footprint and around 1.3 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to ICAO.

SAF can be made from a variety of materials and byproducts, from agricultural waste and specially grown crops to used oils, inedible fats and everyday household trash."
2875,https://www.greenbiz.com/article/can-shell-help-pilot-new-era-sustainable-aviation,Can Shell help pilot a new era of sustainable aviation?,95,"SAF is what’s called a drop-in fuel, meaning it can substitute one-to-one for traditional, kerosene-based jet fuel, known as Jet A, though current technologies limit the percentage of SAF to no more than about 50 percent on a given flight. That’s a largely theoretical limit. Because of SAF’s higher price and limited availability, most planes flying with SAF operate with a blend of less than 1 percent SAF — barely enough to justify bragging rights. Most SAF is deployed in Europe and in California, where policy initiatives provide incentives for SAF and other low-carbon fuels."

2883,https://www.greenbiz.com/article/can-shell-help-pilot-new-era-sustainable-aviation,Can Shell help pilot a new era of sustainable aviation?,77,"The ""price sensitivity"" Sherbacow speaks of is no small thing. A gallon of SAF can cost up to five times that of Jet A, according to S&P Global Platts Analytics, and it’s unlikely that market forces alone can bring that down to the point where the demand for SAF could justify dramatically scaling up production. Given that fuel is an airline’s second-biggest expense after labor, SAF’s price premium is pretty much a show-stopper, at least without incentives."
