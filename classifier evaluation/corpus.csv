SDG_13;scenario starts with data from Shell’s Sky scenario, but there are important updates. First, the outlook uses the most recent modelling for the impact of and recovery from COVID-19 consistent with a Sky 1.5 scenario narrative. Second, it blends this projection into existing Sky (2018) energy system data by around 2030. Third, the extensive scale-up of nature-based solutions is brought into the core scenario, which benefits from extensive new modelling of that scale-up. In 2018, nature-based solutions required to achieve 1.5 degrees Celsius (1.5°C) above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century were analysed as a sensitivity to Sky. This analysis was also reviewed and included in the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C. Fourth, our new oil and natural gas supply modelling, with an outlook consistent with the Sky 1.5 narrative and demand, is presented for the first time. Fifth, the Sky 1.5 scenario draws on the latest historical data and estimates up to 2020 from various sources, particularly the extensive International Energy Agency energy statistics. As with Sky, this scenario assumes that society achieves 
SDG_7;We work continually to improve the energy efficiency of our facilities. This includes monitoring electricity use, making equipment more efficient through regular and smart scheduling of maintenance, and using more renewable energy sources. For example, in 2020, we invested in new furnaces for our Moerdijk petrochemicals complex in the Netherlands to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions by around 10% compared with 2019 (see Energy efficiency in our operations). 
;SESCo reviews and considers external stakeholder perspectives in relation to Shell’s business, as well as how Shell addresses issues of public concern that could affect its reputation and licence to operate. Examples include plastic waste, methane emissions, human rights, the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and access to energy in low- and middle-income countries. 
;We continue to improve the relevance and readability of the report by clearly describing Shell’s role in addressing global challenges. This includes details of our Powering Progress business strategy, which builds on Shell’s long-standing commitment to contribute to sustainable development (see Sustainability at Shell). 
SDG_12;Circular economy We are preparing for regulations and requirements that aim to create a more circular economy, such as those arising from changes to European Union directives on waste. A circular economy is based on the idea that things are designed to last longer and to be reused, repurposed, or recycled. 
SDG_13;METHANE EMISSIONS Methane is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) and when it is released into the atmosphere it has a much higher immediate global warming impact than carbon dioxide. 
;We have a global portfolio of nature-based projects, for example, the Katingan Peatland Restoration and Conservation Project in Indonesia, through which we can help our customers to offset their CO2 emitted from their use of fuels they buy from us. We also provide customers with tailor-made solutions for environmental compliance markets globally. Compliance markets are a mechanism through which companies can comply with environmental regulations and manage their emissions by trading carbon credits. 
SDG_2;Turning waste into fuel Most biofuels are produced from agricultural crops, such as corn, sugar cane, or vegetable oil. We are exploring ways to use agricultural or animal waste, inedible crops, and waste wood to produce biofuels. 
;In Germany, through our participation in the H2 Mobility Germany joint venture, we are working with the government and partners to develop a national network of 100 hydrogen refuelling stations by 2021. At the end of 2020, 87 stations were open, 37 at Shell retail sites. 
;Shell and automobile manufacturer Hyundai execute joint research and development programs, particularly for the first-fill lubricants to address Hyundai’s specific engine requirements. The integrated energy giant remains the official sponsor for Hyundai Shell MOBIS World Rally Team since 2014, and has manufactured and delivered advanced lubricants, which have favored the second consecutive victory of the team.
SDG_7, SDG_13;API and the U.S. oil and gas industry face mounting pressure from their European members, which have moved aggressively over the past year to address climate change. Shell, Total and BP are investing heavily in wind and solar power, as well as electric vehicle charging stations, to prepare for a low-carbon future. Their largest American counterparts, Chevron and Exxon Mobil, have been slower to adopt renewables, instead working to reduce carbon emissions from their oil and gas operations through investments in carbon capture and storage technology.
SDG_16;In December 2018, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (FRN) filed a civil claim against Royal Dutch Shell in the English High Court regarding OPL 245. In May 2020, the court declined jurisdiction and ruled the FRN is not entitled to bring these claims in England. In September 2020, an appeals court denied the FRN’s request to be allowed to appeal against the High Court’s ruling.
SDG_13;That may seem an audacious notion from a company whose business model for well over a century has centered around bringing fossil fuels to market — and is banking on petroleum being a key, albeit declining, fuel for decades to come. And it may seem unlikely that an industry as carbon-intensive as aviation — a hard-to-abate sector, in the argot of the climate policy crowd — somehow might emerge with its green credentials flying high in a climate-constrained world.
SDG_12, SDG_13;Some of that is driven by CORSIA, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, a 2016 agreement governing international flights, developed by the 191-nation International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a United Nations body. CORSIA applies only to international flights, which account for most of aviation’s carbon footprint and around 1.3 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to ICAO. The goal was to have carbon-neutral growth beginning next year — that is, to decouple greenhouse gas emissions from increases in air travel.
SDG_13, SDG_17;"The demand for high-quality carbon offsets has been growing steadily in recent years, thanks in part to the spate of net-zero commitments put forth by companies, industries, cities and nations. And that’s just for voluntary offsets. There’s a much larger compliance market, where utilities and other regulated entities buy and ""retire"" offsets to meet certain mandatory caps. The most active compliance program is the United Nations Clean Development Mechanism, the source of offsets for Kyoto Protocol signatory nations, as well as buyers in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme."
;Reuters reported in November 2020 that the company was closing its refinery in Convent, Louisiana, the largest such U.S. facility and first on the U.S. Gulf Coast to shut down since the coronavirus pandemic devastated worldwide demand ( here ).
SDG_7, SDG_13;Climate action: To realise a net-zero world, the energy  industry must reduce emissions in the supply chain of  renewable energy technologies and phase out fossil fuel- based activities. 
SDG_7;Coal consumption (million tonnes) Strong commitment to engage in the development of  green hydrogen technologies and to deploy energy storage  solutions where meaningful. 
SDG_6, SDG_12, SDG_15;Sustainability  challenge Consumption and recycling of resources: Natural resources  are currently being used faster than their reproduction rate.  This impacts natural ecosystems, e.g. through water scarcity  and waste pollution. To reduce consumption and ensure  availability, it is crucial to use resources sustainably. 
;Our progress • We have established a leadership role in our Global Talent  function (a Head of Talent Identification & Deployment).  • We have increased investment in our learning platform,  Ørsted Academy (in-person, virtual, and digital training). • We have launched several new virtual initiatives for  employee development, including webinar sessions on  career development, a new learning management system,  and a global learning week for employees to learn about  Ørsted’s business from internal and external speakers. • We have missed our 2020 target despite significant  investments in 2019 and 2020 in employee learning  resources and programmes and in enabling managers to  develop their talent.

;The development area for Gode Wind 3 is located about 32 kilometers from the island of Norderney in Cluster 3 within the German North Sea exclusive economic zone (EEZ).
SDG_7;Combining energy storage with generation is a smart way to add value to renewable deployments, clean the grid and add resilience. It allows solar and wind projects to sell the energy to the grid when rates are higher or when the power makeup is especially dirty (conditions which often occur at the same times). Batteries are also a critical tool for ensuring energy resilience, especially as the grid becomes increasingly dependent on renewable power.
SDG_7, SDG_9, SDG_12;In a little more than a decade, Ørsted has transformed from a carbon-intensive utility to the world’s most sustainable energy company, with a 1.5C-aligned business model. Having reduced carbon emissions by 87 % since 2006, the company is on track to become carbon-neutral in energy generation and operations by 2025. The company also aims to achieve net-zero emissions in the entire carbon footprint by 2040 by gradually phasing out wholesale buying and selling of natural gas and decarbonising the supply chain.
